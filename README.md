Hello these are my edits to skiwithpete's repo located at https://github.com/skiwithpete/alarmpi

Here's the link to the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=julETnOLkaU

special thanks to 2006Wicket for helping me make changes to my to the alarm config routes
  
  "For example, get_weather_yahoo.py has a line "config.read('alarm.conf')" which I changed to           "config.read('/home/pi/alarmpi/alarm.config')"
  
  
Also I found I needed to use sudo crontab -e to call my files rather than crontab -e
